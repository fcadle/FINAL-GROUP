This is what a form looks like. You see tons of them on websites all over the place.
The example that we have is an e-mail form. You give the person a box to put their information.
After, they press the submit button that has the value "sign me up!".
It resembles to somethng you see on the internet when you have to use your e-mail to sign up for something. 
<br>
<h1> Hey y'all, sign up for our new prize!!! </h1>
<form>
E-mail: <input type="text" name="email" id="email"><br>
<input type="submit" value="sign me up!">
<input type="reset">
</form>

We love web development, right?
