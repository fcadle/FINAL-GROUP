<h1> Welcome to Web Development Class </h1>
<h2> We've gone over a ton of things fromm the beginning of this semeseter to the end of it.
However, for this project we will only be covering a few. One of these elements that we will be showing is the box shadow. Like its name, its the shadow of a box.
Next, we will be showing linear gradient. That is having colors going up and down on the page. Also we will be showing the use of tables. Tables are literally tables like you would see anywhere else.
<br>
<br>
This project was executed by our whole group. Everyone contributed equally and did a grand job. We hope that everyone enjoys our work. Also thanks Mr. Narock for teaching us these key aspects to the web development. </h2>
<h3>This is our project. </h3>
